My inspo is Journaling has always been a therapeutic way to reflect upon my feelings. However, there was a lack of platforms that combined the act of journaling with emotion tracking and intelligent insights. The vision for EmoInsight stemmed from this gap â€” a space where individuals can not only write down their feelings but also receive feedback, understand emotional patterns, and get guidance.
